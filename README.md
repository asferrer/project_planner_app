> **Visual project planning, resource leveling, cost estimation and Gantt charts ‚Äî all in one app.**

## üß† Overview

**Advanced Project Planner** is a powerful Streamlit-based application designed for project managers, engineers, and team leaders. It simplifies complex project planning by integrating:

- Task scheduling with detailed effort (Person-Hours) and dependency tracking.
- Role-based resource assignments with specific allocations.
- Sophisticated, effort-based resource leveling considering daily availability.
- Customizable working calendars with weekly defaults and monthly overrides.
- Interactive Gantt charts for timeline visualization.
- Dependency graphing.
- Resource workload analysis.
- Comprehensive cost estimation and breakdown, with Excel export capabilities.

## üåü Features

### ‚úÖ Task Management
- Add, edit, and organize tasks into Phases (project stages).
- Define task effort in Person-Hours (PH).
- Set start dates and manage dependencies between tasks.
- Track task status (Pending, In Progress, Completed, etc.).
- Assign multiple roles to tasks with specific allocation percentages for that task.
- Add detailed notes to each task.

### üìÖ Intelligent Scheduling
- **Effort-Based Duration**: Task durations are dynamically estimated based on total effort and the combined capacity of assigned resources.

- Customizable Working Calendar:
  - Define a default weekly working schedule (hours per day).
  - Implement monthly overrides for specific working patterns (e.g., summer hours).
  - Option to include or exclude weekends as standard working days.

- **Dependency-Aware Scheduling**: Automatically calculates task start dates based on the completion of predecessor tasks.

- **Resource Leveling (Effort-Based)**:
  - Reschedules tasks considering task dependencies and daily resource capacity.
  - Capacity is derived from role availability, system working hours, and effort already scheduled on other tasks.
  - Attempts to resolve resource overloads by shifting tasks according to their ID priority.

### üìà Interactive Gantt Charts
- Timeline view with tasks colored by their Phase.
- Hover tooltips display task details including duration, assignments, cost, dependencies, and status.
- Visualizes actual working segments, skipping non-working days.

### üîó Dependency Graph
- Visualizes task relationships and dependencies as a clear flowchart using Graphviz.

### üë• Resource Load Visualization
- Analyze daily workload (in hours) per role against their calculated capacity.
- Highlights potential resource overloads.
- Provides a summary of total person-hours per role.

### üí∞ Cost Analysis
- Calculates task costs based on effort, role assignments, and defined hourly rates.
- Provides an overall project financial summary including gross cost, profit margin, and selling price.
- Detailed cost breakdown by role and by task.
- **Export Cost Model to Excel**: Generates a multi-sheet Excel file with costs per phase, per task (with role dedications), and project parameters.

### üíæ Data Management
- Create new empty projects.
- Load a sample AI project template to get started quickly.
- Export and import complete project plans in JSON format, preserving all settings, tasks, roles, and phases.


## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

The application is built within a single Python script (`project_planner.py`) using Streamlit for the user interface and Pandas/Plotly for data manipulation and visualization.

- **Streamlit UI**: Provides the interactive front-end for users to define project parameters, manage tasks, trigger calculations, and view results.

- **Planning Engine (Integrated)**:
  - Calculates task durations based on effort and resource allocation.
  - Determines task end dates considering working calendars.
  - Performs resource leveling by iteratively scheduling tasks based on dependencies and daily resource availability.
  - Computes costs and generates data for visualizations.

## üß© JSON Structure

Your project plan can be saved and loaded as a JSON file. The main keys are:
- `roles`: Defines each role, their availability_percent, and rate_eur_hr.
- `tasks`: A list of tasks, each with:
  - `id`: Unique identifier.
  - ``phase``: The name of the phase the task belongs to.
  - ``subtask``: Specific name of the subtask.
  - ``phase_color``: Hex color code for the phase.
  - ``name``: Auto-generated full name (Phase - Subtask).
  - ``start_date``: ISO format date string (YYYY-MM-DD).
  - ``effort_ph``: Estimated person-hours for the task.
  - ``duration_calc_days``: Calculated duration in working days (float).
  - ``assignments``: List of dictionaries, e.g., [{"role": "AI Engineer", "allocation": 50.0}].
  - ``dependencies``: JSON string of a list of prerequisite task IDs, e.g., "[1, 2]".
  - ``status``: Current task status.
  - ``notes``: Additional information.
  - ``end_date``: Calculated end date in ISO format (populated after planning/leveling).
- ``next_task_id``: The next available ID for new tasks.
- `config`: Project-level settings:
  - ``project_start_date``: ISO format date string.
  - ``exclude_weekends``: Boolean.
  - ``working_hours``: Contains default weekly schedule and monthly_overrides.
  - ``profit_margin_percent``: Float.
- ``phases``: A dictionary mapping phase names to their hex color codes, e.g., {"Design Phase": "#ADD8E6"}.
